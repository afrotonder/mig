# MIG: Metadata Image Generator

Welcome to MIG. This simple script was made to solve the particular problem some NFT creators face when creating NFTs in a way that doesnt generate metadata.

NOTE: This example is assuming youre using factoria.app to create your NFT collection.


## How to run
1. Clone project.
2. Upload your files to IPFS via factoria. This will generate image JSON files for each file uploaded.
3. Download the created image files.
4. Extract downloaded ZIP and drop the files into the cloned project directory called newImagesJSON.
5. Run script with python3 mig.py
